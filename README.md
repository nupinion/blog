## Data Blog Code

Repo with useful code for recreating some of the vizs in our data blog

Code will typically be in python, for extracting and analysing data, or javascript for creating visualisations.

To Do:

* Movie reviews need to iterate over all pages
* Movie reviews need to be wrapped in a function that accepts a movie-id
* User ratings don't iterate over all pages yet
* User reviews/ratings need to be wrapped in a function that accepts a user-id

Please send any comments to info@nupinion.com. We'd love to hear about any bugs or improvements to our approach.
